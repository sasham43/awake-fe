## Awake Front End Challenge

For this challenge, I wanted to display an overview of the provided data set that would enable a stakeholder to get a sense of the emotional state of their patient.  The user can select between anxiety level and BPM and the chosen statistic will be displayed on a chart.  The user can also select different times and days to see how the individual fared.  Each data point can be selected to view more information.

### My experience

I will admit that this challenge was more difficult than I had anticipated.  I got a few ideas for how to visualize the provided data pretty quickly, but actual implementation of those ideas was much slower and more laborious than I'm used to.  I initially wanted two different screens, one the general overview that I provided above, and the second was to be a simulated "real time" experience where the data would be fed minute-by-minute to simulate the actual behavior of a real watch.  In the end, I took much longer than the advised 2-3 hours to complete just the first part of what I wanted to accomplish (somewhere in the 5-7 hour range).  By the time I had hit 3 hours, I knew that I wasn't at all happy with what I had programmed so far, and felt I would rather continue working past the deadline to at least show you something somewhat acceptable.
